                       --> version 0.4 <--

Hackety Hack is a programming starter kit.  Learn to program from
right inside Hackety Hack and immediately start writing handy, little
programs!  Write your own blog or download YouTube videos, perhaps.

Hackety Hack was designed with the help of a group of about fifty 
folks, many of them brand-new to programming.  I am seriously
indebted to them!  As a result, Hackety Hack has a very nice set
of lessons, all of them very easy and terribly useful.

Lastly, the help manual is very detailed, full of examples.

and help us get the kinks worked out.
