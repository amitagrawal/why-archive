 . Hackety Hack .
 . for Mac OS X, Windows XP/Vista, and Linux .

 Hackety Hack is a programming starter kit. It's an editor
 with helpful coding tools and built-in messaging (so you can
 pass scripts to friends easily.)

 . Building Hackety Hack .

 If you are an advanced user (familiar with C and Ruby,) you
 may enjoy helping out with H-ety H.

 With Shoes installed, you can checkout the source code and
 start things up like so:

   $ git clone git@github.com:why/hacketyhack.git 
   $ cd hacketyhack
   $ shoes h-ety-h.rb

 If you want to build Hackety Hack as a standalone app
 with the installer for your platform:

   $ git clone git@github.com:why/hacketyhack.git 
   $ git clone git@github.com:why/shoes.git 
   $ cd shoes
   $ rake APP=../hacketyhack VIDEO=1
   $ rake APP=../hacketyhack installer

 There is no installer for Linux, bear in mind.
